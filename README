DESCRIPTION
    Douglas Crockford describes a *Base32 Encoding* at
    <http://www.crockford.com/wrmg/base32.html>. He says: "[Base32 Encoding
    is] a 32-symbol notation for expressing numbers in a form that can be
    conveniently and accurately transmitted between humans and computer
    systems."

    This module provides methods to convert numbers to and from that
    notation.
